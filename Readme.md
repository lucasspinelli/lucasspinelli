### About me üòÑ
Hey everyone! I'm Lucas, though you can just call me **Levi**.
My journey in tech kicked off with a degree in Analysis and Systems Development, where I built a solid foundation, especially on the **back-end** side of things. It was cool, but my path really shifted when I got curious about security.
That curiosity led me to pursue a postgraduate degree in **Ethical Hacking and Cybersecurity**. It genuinely ignited my passion for keeping digital assets safe. Since 2022, I've been working as a **Security Engineer**, which means I spend my days identifying vulnerabilities, implementing robust controls, and championing secure development practices. When I'm not doing that, you'll often find me diving into CTF competitions and bug bounty programs a great way to keep my offensive and defensive security skills sharp and have some fun, plus some bountys.
